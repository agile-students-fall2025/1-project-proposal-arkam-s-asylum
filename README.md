## What We're Building and Why üåê

We're proposing **Upstore**, a mobile-first web app that lets small, local businesses set up their own online shops, no tech skills required. Think of it as a DIY kit for e-commerce.

Right now, a lot of small businesses are struggling to compete online. Big platforms like Shopify or Wix can be expensive and complicated, especially for a small bakery or a local artisan. Upstore is our answer to that problem. We want to give them an intuitive, affordable, and flexible platform so they can focus on what they do best: creating amazing products and connecting with customers.

This project is important because it's about leveling the playing field. We want to empower entrepreneurs and help them thrive in a digital world without the headache of complex website development.

## Who We're Helping üè¨

Upstore is designed for **small business owners, freelancers, and individual entrepreneurs**. Our goal is to make it easy for people like:

- Local cafes, bakeries, and food trucks.
- Artisans and crafters who sell handmade goods.
- Freelancers who need a simple way to sell services or digital products.
- Anyone running a micro-business on social media, especially on Instagram, who wants a direct way to sell.

We'd like to start by working with small businesses on campus and in our community. This will give us a chance to get direct feedback and make sure we're building something that people truly need.

## How it Works

From a user's perspective, Upstore will be super simple. Here‚Äôs what they‚Äôll be able to do:

1.  **Create a Store**
    - A straightforward sign-up process.
    - Beautiful, pre-designed templates to make their storefront look great instantly.
    - Custom URLs and easy ways to add their logo and brand colors.

2.  **Manage Products**
    - Effortlessly add, edit, and remove products with photos, descriptions, and prices.
    - Organize products into categories and track inventory if they want to.

3.  **Accept Payments**
    - Connect with popular payment gateways like Stripe and PayPal.
    - Get a simple dashboard to see sales history and basic analytics.
    - *Note: We're exploring this feature with a caveat due to legal restrictions on our student visas for setting up a US business / online payment systems. We'd like to find a solution or alternative.*

4.  **Integrate with Social Media**
    - Easily link up their Instagram and other social accounts.
    - Let customers share products with their friends with a single click.

We're also thinking about some **cool features for the future**: things like customer reviews, a detailed analytics dashboard to track visitors, and automated order confirmation emails.

The user flow is as simple as it gets: sign up ‚Üí pick a template/customize their store ‚Üí upload products ‚Üí set up payments ‚Üí publish their store. They'll manage everything from a mobile-friendly dashboard.

## Our Plan üéØ

We‚Äôve made sure Upstore is a great fit for a semester-long project with our team of 4-5 people.

- It‚Äôs a full-stack project, which means we‚Äôll work on the frontend, backend, database, and integrating with other services like payment and social media APIs.
- We have solid **stretch goals** with features like AI-assisted product descriptions and advanced analytics, so we can go above and beyond the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) without overcomplicating things.
- Our team can split up the work naturally: frontend, backend, database, integrations, and testing.

We feel that the project is the perfect balance‚Äîit‚Äôs **challenging but completely achievable**. We hope to be able to deliver a great product by the end of the semester

## Final Thoughts ü§î

This project is personal for us. We're not just building a product; we're creating a real solution for people who pour their heart into their small businesses. Upstore is a chance to show our skills while making a tangible difference, and that‚Äôs what gets us excited. We can‚Äôt wait to build a platform that truly helps people succeed.
